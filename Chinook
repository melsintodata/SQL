In this project, I used data to gain insights into customer base, sales performance, and operational effectiveness, with the goal of improving business outcomes and profitability. 

#Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *

LIMIT 5;

SELECT FirstName,LastName,Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *

SELECT LastName, FirstName, Title

# Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry

#Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country

#Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry

#Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
